# Question-Section-for-Team-18
Here are the questions for the SecureWitness project

1.	Does the Python app needed to decrypt files on our local machine need to be uploaded to the web for downloading? Or should team members each only store a copy of it on local machines?

2.	Is file encryption supposed to be done on the local machine in the stand-alone program, or should it be done in the web application?

3.	Can files uploaded to the system be entirely public? Or must they all be private with “permissions to view” for specific users?
