# Question-Section-for-Team-18
Here are the questions for the SecureWitness project

1.	Does the Python app needed to decrypt files on our local machine need to be uploaded to the web for downloading? Or should team members each only store a copy of it on local machines?

2.	Is file encryption supposed to be done on the local machine in the stand-alone program, or should it be done in the web application?

3.	Can files uploaded to the system be entirely public? Or must they all be private with “permissions to view” for specific users?

4. Can messages be publicly sent to individuals?

5. How about sent to many individuals publicly (like a Facebook status) or privately (group message)?

6. Can site managers suspend other site managers?

7. Do site managers also have reporter rights?

8. Can reporters view who has actually downloaded their data?

9. The information and files will be uploaded using a web application. Can the users view files on the web application? If so, can the users view encrypted files on the web application?
 
10. Does the web application require a graphical user interface?
 
11. A reporter can mark a report as encrypted. If a file is not marked as encrypted, does it need to be encrypted before uploading to the server?
 
12. A reporter can leave a private message for a specific user. Can the user view messages left for him/her on both the web application and the stand-alone program?
 
13. Do we need to use a specific type of encryption? How will the keys be stored?
